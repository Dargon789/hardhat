## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please report any security vulnerability by using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature, which can be found in the 'Security' tab of our repository.

You can expect a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate with you on the public disclosure.
